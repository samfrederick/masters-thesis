%\chapter{Impacts of emissions spatial heterogeneity on aerosol properties in a particle resolved framework}

This chapter presents results for the impacts of emissions spatial heterogeneity on aerosol properties, including changes to the aerosol size distribution, composition, mixing state, and CCN activity. We begin with a set of simplified simulations to isolate the effect of spatial heterogeneity on an important aerosol process, coagulation. Subsequently, we present simulation results for full multiphase (gas and aerosol) chemistry runs and discuss changes to aerosol properties and CCN activity. We find that under high emissions spatial heterogeneity, up to 25\% more CCN activate in the upper boundary layer for supersaturations in the range $S=0.3\%$ to $S=0.6\%$. 
\section{Idealized coagulation simulations}

Prior to discussing simulations utilizing the full multiphase chemical mechanism for aerosols and chemistry, we first focus our discussion on the impact of spatial heterogeneity on aerosol number concentration due to coagulation. Coagulation is a primary mechanism for aerosol aging and its rate scales with the square of the number concentration of particles, thus making it an important aerosol processes for which to evaluate the impacts of spatial heterogeneity. 

\subsection{Simulation scenarios}

\begin{figure}[h]

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/chapter5/ideal-coag/ideal-coag-SH-scenarios.pdf}
    \caption{$SH$ scenarios for ideal coagulation simulations.}
    \label{fig:sh-scenarios-ideal-coag}
\end{figure}

Here we investigate the modification to the rate of coagulation under numerous spatial heterogeneity scenarios. We run a total of 6 simulations for a range of $SH$ scenarios shown in Figure \ref{fig:sh-scenarios-ideal-coag}. As with gas phase simulations in chapter 4, the concentration of atmospheric constituents (here aerosol particle number concentration) must be scaled within the $SH$ scenario region by the ratio of the area of the uniform base case and the area occupied by the $SH$ pattern. For example, the number concentrations in the central region of scenario 5 are a factor of 10,000 higher than in the uniform base case. 

Note that the setup of these simulations differs from all other simulations discussed in this thesis. Chemistry is turned off primarily for computational efficiency as, here, we are simply interested in changes to the number concentration rather than changes to aerosol composition. Rather than using initial conditions that are uniform throughout the domain, here the aerosol initial condition is set by the chosen $SH$ scenario for each vertical level in the domain (i.e., the pattern extends vertically throughout the domain). Additionally, emissions are turned off such that only coagulation is responsible for changes to aerosol number concentration.

\subsection{Results}

\begin{figure}[!h]

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/chapter5/ideal-coag/NumConcTimescale_composite.pdf}
    \caption{Total number concentration for each $SH$ scenario normalized by the initial condition total number concentration. Lines indicate normalized number concentration averaged over each vertical level in the domain. (a) Uniform base case. (b--f) Scenarios 1--5}
    \label{fig:numconc-timescales}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:numconc-timescales} show how the total number concentration of aerosol particles decreases due to coagulation under each $SH$ scenario. For each scenario, we compute the average number concentration at each vertical level and time $t$, $\overline{N}_{\text{total}}(t)$. This number concentration is then normalized by the number concentration at time $t=0$, $\overline{N}_{\text{total}}(t=0)$. A subset of number concentration timeseries are shown in Figure \ref{fig:numconc-timescales} for the lowest 20 vertical levels of the PBL ($z=0$ m to $z\sim200$ m) and highest 20 vertical levels in the domain above the PBL ($z\sim1.8$ km to $z=2$ km). The reason for this grouping is that these two regions are notably different in terms of the rate at which the total number concentration decreases. For scenarios 1--5 (Figure \ref{fig:numconc-timescales} subfigures b--f), we find that the total number concentration decreases slower in the lower PBL than above the PBL. A notable exception to this trend is the uniform base case (Figure \ref{fig:numconc-timescales} subfigure a). Recall that the rate of coagulation scales as the square of the number of particles. As a result, highly heterogeneous patterns that require significant scaling up of the number concentration will have greater rates of coagulation within the high-concentration region associated with the $SH$ pattern. As the PBL develops and turbulent motion begins to diffuse the initial structure of the $SH$ pattern, concentration gradients are reduced, resulting in a reduction of the rate of coagulation. This turbulent motion does not disturb the structure of the $SH$ pattern above the PBL, and thus coagulation will proceed at a faster rate within the high concentration region of the $SH$ pattern.

We find that as the $SH$ increases across scenarios, the total number concentration is reduced more rapidly. For each plot in Figure \ref{fig:numconc-timescales}, we include horizontal dashed lines indicating the e-folding time alongside a half e-folding time ($e^{-1/2}$) and double e-folding time as the rate at which the total number concentration is reduced under $SH$ scenarios varies widely.

    \label{fig:numconc-timescales-to-75pcent}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:numconc-timescales-to-75pcent} shows the time required the number concentration in the lower PBL to be reduced to 75\% of the initial total number concentration plotted against the spatial heterogeneity of each scenario. The uniform base case (``S0") requires over four hours to reach 75\% of the initial total concentration, while the highest heterogeneity scenarios 4 and 5 require only 10 minutes.

\section{Full multiphase simulations}

Here we discuss simulations containing full multiphase chemistry under numerous emissions spatial heterogeneity scenarios. A summary of emissions scenarios is presented followed by presentation of results pertaining to the aerosol state and properties under each emission scenario. 

\subsection{Simulated emissions scenarios}

\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{figures/SH-scenarios-main-runs.pdf}
    \caption{Emissions scenarios for multiphase chemistry simulations. The spatial heterogeneity of each emission scenario is listed in the lower portion of each scenario alongside domain mean and variance.
}
    \label{fig:aerosol-emission-scenarios}
\end{figure}

Scenarios discussed in this section match the set of emissions scenarios discussed in Chapter 4 Section \ref{gas-emission-scenarios}. We evaluate changes to the aerosol population under four scenarios as shown in Figure \ref{fig:aerosol-emission-scenarios}.  with increasing spatial heterogeneity with the first scenario being a ``uniform base case" with diffuse, uniform emissions across the ground level of the domain ($SH=0$). Scenarios 1--3 contain increasing spatial heterogeneity, whereby the rate of emissions is scaled to ensure the total mass per unit time emitted across each scenario is the same.

\subsection{Aerosol size distributions}

\begin{figure}[!t]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/chapter5/number-distribution-plots.pdf}
    \caption{Aerosol number distribution plots for each emissions scenario. The distribution initial condition (light blue) is shown alongside the distribution at the end of each simulation ($t=6$ h). Scenarios are labeled as the following: (a) uniform base case, (b) scenario 1, (c) scenario 2, (d) scenario 3.}
    \label{fig:number-dists}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:number-dists} shows aerosol number distributions for each simulated emissions scenario. The initial condition size distribution is presented alongside the size distribution at the end of each simulation ($t=6$ h). Each size distribution is taken from a vertical level in the upper boundary layer at $z\sim800$ \si{m}. Due to the stochastic treatment aerosols in the WRF-PartMC model and the chosen number of computational particles per grid cell ($n=100$), size distributions represent the average distribution in a 1 \si{km^2} region centered over the emissions plume. For all scenarios except scenario 1, this region is located at the center of the domain. For scenario 1, emissions are released in one half of the domain that is offset from the center, thus the averaging region for the size distribution is located in the center of the emissions plume. WRF-PartMC returns the number distribution in 100 logarithmically spaced bins ranging from $10^{-9}$ m to $10^{-3}$ m.

For each scenario displayed in Figure \ref{fig:number-dists}, the initial condition size distribution is shown in light blue. The distribution is bimodal, containing an Aitken (left) and accumulation mode (right). The Aitken mode contains fine particulates and is centered around $20$ nm, while the accumulation mode contains slightly fewer particles and is centered around 116 $nm$. 

After 6 hours, the number of particles with diameter smaller than $\sim30$ nm is significantly reduced as these small particles undergo coagulation and grow by gas-to-particle partitioning. For particle diameters greater than $\sim30$ nm, the number concentration is increased under each scenario as primary aerosol are emitted and particles undergo aging. For the uniform base case (Figure \ref{fig:number-dists} subplot a), the distribution still takes on a bimodal shape at $t=6$ h, however the Aitken mode has been replaced by a mode centered around 35 nm and is likely a combination of primary aerosol emissions and growth of smaller particles from the initial Aitken mode. 

Moving to higher emissions spatial heterogeneity scenarios, we find that the number distribution loses its bimodal shape after 6 hours, especially under the highest heterogeneity scenario, scenario 3 (Figure \ref{fig:number-dists} subplot d). For scenario 3, the number distribution peaks around 0.1 $\mu$m. Compared with the uniform base case, the number concentration of particles in the accumulation mode is approximately half an order of magnitude higher ($10^{10}$ \si{m^{-3}} vs. $4\cdot10^9$ \si{m^{-3}}).
