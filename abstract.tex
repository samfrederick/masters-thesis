Aerosol-cloud interactions remain a large source of uncertainty in climate models due to complex, nonlinear processes that alter aerosol properties and the inability to represent the full compositional complexity of aerosol populations within large-scale modeling frameworks. The spatial resolution of these models (typically 10-100 km) is often coarser than the spatially varying emissions in the modeled geographic region. This results in diffuse, uniform emission of primary aerosol and gas-phase species instead of spatially heterogeneous concentrations. Aerosol processes such as gas-particle partitioning and coagulation are concentration-dependent, and thus the representation of spatially heterogeneous emissions impacts aerosol aging and properties. This includes climate-relevant quantities like particle hygroscopicity and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activity. 

This thesis investigates the impact of emissions spatial heterogeneity on CCN activity by using the particle-resolved model PartMC coupled to the Weather Research and Forecasting model configured for large-eddy simulations (LES). The resulting modeling framework resolves turbulence-chemistry interactions and aerosol aging on a per-particle scale. The sensitivity of CCN activity to emissions spatial heterogeneity is evaluated for primary aerosol and gas-phase emissions typical of urban regions. The pattern of emissions is varied to investigate a range of spatially heterogeneity scenarios. For each scenario, CCN activity is compared against a uniform emissions base case to determine the impact of spatially heterogeneous emissions. 

\hl{TODO: update!} We find that CCN concentrations decrease by as much as 10\% with increasing emissions spatial heterogeneity, especially for low supersaturations (S=0.1, 0.3\%). This work is a first of a kind application of high resolution, particle-resolved LES for quantifying structural uncertainty of CCN activity due to the representation of emissions spatial heterogeneity.
